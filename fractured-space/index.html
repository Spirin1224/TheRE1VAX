Endeavor

--

Currently my favorite ship.

--

The ship with my own build, enables my playstyle that seems to make it versatile.

It is an interesting ship. It is versatile, when with crew it can be quite survivable, and turrets allow to to cover ground and soften targets allowing you to flank.

It has good armor which allows it to take a decent beating.

Main weapon is quite effective! I built for high rate of fire. With good damage, AOE, and good range its a fine weapon as you move around your turrets.

Turrets also periodically release missiles. This missile barrage is quite useful on unarmored targets.

Concussion mines deal a very good amount of damage, and can be used to attack ships at a distance, or used defensively if you get rushed.

Gravity well is good for moving large ships out of cover, or even out of open space.

hull, 7500

200hull is 2% more hull. so no good.

Watchman -- USR [United Space Research]

The sniper for USR, boasts very good damage for precise shots at extreme ranges.
8000 base hull hp
600 base speed


======RE1VAX Synapse:
--Extremely niche and high skill curve, but can be very effective at many ships
--Effective solo
--System denial

Tactical Analysis:
[Primary] Railgun: Very long range, decent projectile speed (still hard to hit at long ranges)
Against Amored: Good damage, consistent.
Against Unarmored: Very very good damage. Take out that Destroyer at 21km and not even blink... by yourself.

[Secondary] Short-range void cannon:
<8k range.
Extremely useful. Good damage, useful against small mining ships.
Can be used to augment Railgun at closer ranges for very high potential dps.
360 range.

[Dispersal Slow Shield] Reduces damage by 50% for 5s.  Afterwards, slows enemy ships nearby by 20% for 5s.
--Useful to survive hard attacks or missile salvos. Medium reload (50s).
--Slowing debuff never really proved useful, as turning around is never a good idea, and is hard to do.

[Watchman Missiles] 18km range. Short reload (20s)
--Extremely useful at softening up targets at long ranges. Good for finishing small ships at low health.

[Corrode Drones] 36k range. 30s operation. Reload 20s, if squad dead 75s.
--The extra trick up watchmans sleeve. Corrodes armor of an entire target.
--Very useful for medium to large targets, as this allows primary to deal exceptional damage.
--(Note: I found that the cooldown is quite short in practice)


Other notes:
Ship is good at strafing a target at long ranges. This can make it easier to land leading shots (my personal experience).
In a team situation, this ship can be very good for defending a sector, and preparing for Gamma.
1. Sit in a flanked position middle of the ally side of the sector, close to cover. Lay cover for allies and keep back adversaries.
2. Arrive early in Gamma. Get a good position and strike early, preping them up for ally firepower.

Fractured Space:
—

Ships:
Furion (plasma thrower)


Gladiator (Heavy Class (Capital)):
—
Huge blindspots.

It is angering when suddenly 3 of the enemy blink on-top and above and it becomes quite hard to aim.

So.
Keep you distance, and somehow, never stop moving. Cuz those idiots will swarm.
However:
Does very good damage.
Pounds at medium range with good consistency (however, very hard to aim)

Leviathan
Reaper
Overseer (sniper)
Kepler



Aegis:
—
Energy ship,
Good at mid range, works best with team.
Stick w/ team, go for module cooldowns, because you can spam that particle accelerator.

Excels in combat, with decent speeds.
Crew builds
Build for module cooldown, jump spin-up, and turret aim.


—
Basilisk
—

Use plasma corroder.

Crew notes:
Build for the following.
Damage reduction +
module cooldown +++
Turret travers +

—gameplay
Can team, and can solo medium combat ships.
Key to winning is blasting a huge sum of damage, using corroders, and continued to orbit around enemy, using cover to mitigate attacks.
Get behind cover, cloak, wait, redo,


—
Intercepter
—
Weak ship, cant win at more than one ship at a time.
Very good vs enemies in team, but must stay out of range.



--
Ranger
--

Piece of crap.

I was told ranger is the better sniper...
if it is, it either 
1. Certainly isnt offensivey
or
2. I simply play Watchman magnitudes better than Ranger.

Longbow cannon is alright, but kinicky like a cheap joke. DPS spamming the trigger is almost never as useful as waiting.
Damage it does is just kinda alright, and it isnt good for any sort of alpha strikes.
Also, you can feel the hard cap at 20,000km, and the mines are neat-ish, but kinda go against the concept of sniping.

True, the self heal is more op than I give it credit for, true because I didn't spam it like I should have.
But if the mines and the slow debuff and self heal are what make it better because its more defensive?
id have to seriously disagree.

Watchman is a MUCH better sniper.
For a multitude of reasons.

1. Main weapon is just better.
Not by much, but certainly enough.

2. Corrode Drones are op.
How are they not?, shred the armor of another enemy while engaging another. By the time you finish, the drones will have made the other enemy an easy target.
Considering they have infinite range, and move instantly, they work fantastic for softening up far away large targets--heavies, such as Colossus or Destroyer.

That ability is extremely helpful AND direclty impacts the effectiveness of Watchman.

3. Secondary weapon
the DPS isnt terribly significant, but it does mean you can fire anyone anywhere,
and it does severely punish any enemy openly rushing you.

4. Dispersal Shield
With a good crew, the cooldown can be short. Instead of using it as a last ditch effort, consider using it during or right before engagements to ward off most of the damage. (Instead of waiting until your health is gone and you are outgunned.)

--

TLDR
Whoever said Watchman is a better sniper is either...
1. Lying
2. Ignorant
3. Can play it better than they can play Watchman

Side by side the results are clear for themselves.

Unless self-heal is what BREAKS this thing, im not buying that Ranger is a better sniper than Watchman.

And even then, Ranger would only win based off of defense.

Heck, maybe its better cuz its smaller and a tad more maneuverable.
 ‭‭‭



—
Equalizer
—
Useful, must stay quick, has small health.
Keep hitting enemies spam first module, upgrade damage.



—
Endeavor-
—
A tech of techs, makes turrets, does very good damage, dominates battlefield.
Does very good damage, does better with a team.

Play zone offense/defense. Use cover and orbit around cover, staying above or below battlefield, augmenting turrets and allied firepower.


—
Punisher
—

Very good damage ship.
Shield is good for taking light damage.
Has very good to moderate guns

Stay at medium range and orbit one-side of the enemy, Plasma Orb and every solid round after that does improved damage.

Can 1v1 a Destroyer.


—
Raven
—

Very very good damage ship,
Can 1v1 anything anywhere.

Anytime.

Gameplay:
Move! And get as much energy as you can.
Use obstacles and strafe, DO NOT GET CLOSE TO ENEMIES!
Use Absorb Energy to get Overcharge beam up and running.

Overcharge Beam:
Powerful hit beam, try and hit same spot on enemy (obviously)

Energy Absorber:
Fire a aimable charge, if the charge hits a enemy, you get their energy.
This is the most important abilite in your aresenal.


—
Raider
—
Decent support ship, low armor.
—
Without understanding abilities you will die, as it is a rather flimsy ship.
However.
The following will get you huge damage,
—

You must be close for main weapons.
Biggest damage is the following, MINES!
Short-range blasts that deal VERY good damage (4k!!), + the scalpel and missiles, = ability to handle.

Remember the following.
Distance for gun is 10k (right below)
Raider mines are 500m range, or right when a enemy is close to you (have them have to follow you through them), remember, 45s cooldown.
Raider missiles! Dont forget them! 20second cooldown!




Executioner -- Titan Defense Systems
--Milspec useless

Reasons:
Primary has incredibly long charge time
Primary has incredibly slow projectile speed
Primary has short range
Primary does lackluster damage on armored ships (~750)
No secondary weapon
No defense
[Overdrive] finicky and also reduces damage by a marginal amount. Using it resets your current recharging weapon rate.
[Chrono Blink] Never had a use for it really. (Sprint to enemy base, they show up, blink away?)

Notes:
Can do 3k(?) hits on unarmored targets.
This boosted unarmored damage may make the ship effective in two scenarios.
	1. With a dedicated team of ally ships that strip armor of enemies and slow them down
	2. With team attacking a large target without being flanked.
[Executioner Missiles] More useful than you think. Low reload time (15s), fast speed, good damage against unarmored adversaries.
[Stasis Field Buoy] Does work, but you will most likely be too far away, and optimal effect time is very low. LONG recharge.
