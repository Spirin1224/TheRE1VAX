'COGNIZANT' - Stabia

So. This is what I main, and this is what I play.

What is its playstyle?

Its really a tacticians ship, in and out of ranges, around the field.
Moving is both your friend and your enemy, knowing when to be seen, and what to see.

This ship has low health, and lower consistent dps.

It makes up for having high ptw burst damage, high burst damage, and fair speed.

Note that this mild speed boost is highly advantageous vs the other Artillery cruisers (and in general),,
this is because the other two are QUITE slow (slower than average), and BOTH have arc limited primary firing solutions.

Allows me to dodge for a timem
And more than that, the ability to control range efficiently/optimally.
--

It is true, having glass cannon really unlocks damage of Particle Cannon.

So in line with those things, it fits with how I use it.
I use a few tactical systems to make this build happen.

1. Cloak and move//regen
2. Feedback Loop

It works like this.
Save for energy, queue modules on reload, cloak, move, watch and wait.

When I see a viable target, I simply cancel pte and let energy refill (should already be near top), and ptw full salvo.

Reload modules, rinse, repeat. I can choose when to recloak (and thus reload my next batch of feedback loop energy injection).

-Important Targets
I try and get nice and close, waiting in cloak for 1. me to be optimally ready, and 2. to both catch them off-guard and in a optimal situation for me.

Use Rupture Catalyst, hope it lands, and then ptw. This is enough to do hopefully INSANE damage.
Lets count, Rupture Catalyst (1.5x multi), on +20% glass cannon + ptw + full volley.

And while its max potential damage is good, its more about acheiving the per shot count to offset any enemy regeneration (and to get through shields perhaps).
This is especially true vs healers, or other mid targets in their allied healing range.


Rupture Catalyst /vs/ Siege Mode
Rupture costs no energy, so hit, follow up with ptw salvo.

Or

On the other hand, lead with ptw, when energy is drained -- then use siege mode.
This is good because the followup is near instant unlike waiting for Rupture to reload to primaries.

--Energy
Thats the name of the game.

The ability to be efficient allows me to be effective. That is why I use navi expert. Navi expert + feedback loop (crew and the right modules), highly efficient pte.
Feedback loop also allows high energy regeneration, that allows me to efficiently and quickly cycle through ptw for any targets I am aiming for.
Energy is also needed for defensive maneurvering or for shields. Having just a small tad of energy can be the difference between survival or a respawn screen.



--

full salvo glass cannon = 11520, regular is 9600.
full salvo ptw + glass cannon = 17610. (mid range)
Rupture: After rupture, its theoretically 26415 max volley damage.

ptw gives a 60.4% increase to projectile damage(and basically the entire dps multiplier).

Brutus - TheRE1VAX


--My build/playstyle
A: Alpha (standard name)

Purposes: Good damage at a variety of ranges, dedicated anti-artillery//tac cruiser function.

Pretty simple build. Cruise around and do a lot of damage, snipe distant targets.

The Build:
Autocannon Turrets
Light Particle Turrets V
Missile Repeater
WeaponBooster Pulse
Weapon Amplifier

Feedback Loop
Survival Instinct(there is better)
Navigation Expert
Engineering 101 (Or 'Get On My Good Side')

Feedback loop::
- +navi expert allows you to cruise around the map very efficiently,
- energy regenerationss for any ptw at close ranges, or shields at close ranges.

Dealing damage:
I imagine many people use the little laser pointer at a mediume range target, and after like 3 seconds, they give up.

Here is the secret. 

<b>Commit.</b>

After 3 seconds?, not much. After 5?, after 10?.

Remember that Ob Tac Cruiser has highest ptw mutlipluer, ptw + laser pointer = damage!
Harass and put pressure on enemy destroyers! There have been many many times i make them rethink a offensive maneuver because suddenly that have only 75% health.

Needless to say, its also very effective at hitting mid-range enemy corvettes, as well as generally stealing kills.

<div id="PotentialBalanceChanges" class="EA"><a class="lightbox" href="#ShipList"></a><div class="wrapper">
<img id="none" class="ITMImage" href=""></img><div class="ITMContent">


=== <i><b>Reduce Grenada damage by 5% (Projectile damage 5250>>5000.)</b></i><br>
Explanation:
Grenada has the highest projectile damage, highest ptw salvo damage, highest dps, and highest range of any of the three artillery cruisers. This range complements its tradiontal firing arc, but the damage is still absurdly high. 90% of the time the limited firing arc does not inhibit its offensive effectiveness, and its defensive weakness is still does not balance its again absurdly high damage and high range.

As a result of this, many players take and abuse this ship. Its too easy and rewards too easy.
"Its pure cheese." - TheR

Reducing the maximum damage will better inline balance the ship with other classes, and may mitigate the ship being spammed in player matches. (this is my experience mind you, but experience over the course of many many battles).




===   <i><b>Increase Stabia PTW projectile damage from 60.4% to 70%, or 80%.</b></i>
This results in a PTW volley damage from 15398.4 to 17280.

<i><b>Explanation:</b></i> First off, higher tier Oberon Artillerys benefit less and less from PTW than their lower tier counterparts. Second off, they are among the most energy hungry PTW primaries in the ENTIRE GAME. I can only truly get a single volley off of it.

Compare this to other artillery cruisers, and other ships, who can fire more than once, or more than a single volley, and its obvious that PTW Oberon Artillery is underperforming.

Increasing the damage will offset this weaknesss, and provide the class with an advantage that is balanced by the high energy drawbacks. We can also slightly increase ptw energy to better balance this.


===   <i><b>Adjust stasis ammo.</b></i>
1. Allow user to cancel on command.
2. Reloading/switching back to primaries decreased to 1s.
3. Increase time to 10s
Explanation:

While I did say switching it entirely from ammo to pulse, (and it was rash, but also still not a terrible idea), there are still effective reasons for using the weapon as 'the point of effect'.

The main problem is switching back to use primaries /against/ how the the buff lasts for.

-1 Canceling it allows you to not waste time continuing to use it,
this is beneficial.

Example 1:
I use it on Ob Dessie, I hit 2 shots and start slowing.
1. If i cant cancel it
what if I miss the remaining shots? suddenly by the time i run out of shots and get back to primaries, the target either has a pitiful 2s left or is debuffed completely.

Example 2. Being able to cancel it
Allows me to switch back exactly when I want to, allowing close timing perhaps when the target is going around a corner(just barely in visible range), or when I want to of course keep it tight and quick. This also allows (technically) the module to reload quicker because I have ended it sooner than if I let it run the entire time.

You would cancel it by simply tapping the module hotkey again (like with other modules).

-2
This is currently the largest problem/complication in using this module. Many times I get the debuff, and then keep shooting to run out, then there is a lengthy reload to get back to my primaries.
Decreasing reload time to primaries (BY ITSELF) could even fix this module, but I of course strongly recommend allowing users to cancel it themselves.

-3 Sometimes the stasis debuff is a bit short, increasing the time would better balance the module--giving players more time to use primaries or secondaries. (again, not by much but an extra second or two would be beneficial.)

<br><i><b>--  OR/AND  --</b></i><br>

===   <i><b>Change stasis ammo to stasis pulse.</b></i>
Explanation:
This would accomplish two things.

1. Make the module fair to all destroyers. As all players arent limited or affected by what weapon they would use if running stasis ammo.
2. Allow much effective use at very close ranges. (and corvette bolt guns are a nightmare).

The downside of course, is that you have limited range. Perhaps adding this as a module as an option in addition to stasis ammo is the best course perhaps.




===   <i><b>Adjust Rupture Catalyst</b></i>
!! 1 !! Lower reload/switch time to primaries to .6 seconds. (faster than proposed reload from stasis ammo)
2. Increase healing debuff to 33%
3?. Add a shield debuff!?*
4?. Increase damage to enemey by 60%

Explanation:

-1. This module works in tandem with the primaries. Rewarding follow up shots, and a team effort on a target.
This is only possible if you can use the time to hit the target.
The current reload time is incredibly high for artillery cruiser to even use the debuff, wasting the module.

That means most artillery cruisers will suffer their reload time (or a lengthy reload time) before using the module.*

And at only 10seconds, the reload time to firing can take 2s, that leaves only 80% of the time left to use it.
And in the case of Oberon Arty, perhaps only a SINGLE salvo.

Considering this gives no movement debuff, has a LENGTHY cooldown (should be reduced to 40s),
and limited effectiveness,

Fixing the reload to primaries will go a long way in balancing this module.

*[[Note that no artillery cruiser can use the quick-firing module (since of course this takes its slot).]]


-2. Healing debuff of 25% is still almost nothing compared the healing being done on certain targets.
Especially considering the secondary focus is to weaken those in heal-balls.
A modest increase to 33% will make this slightly more effective vs heal balls.

-3 Add a shield debuff?
Again, it does not take down shields. This could potentially be a game balancer because even energy burning modules don't/barely stop the enemy from REGAINING energy.

TLDR. This module is <i>useless</i> against dreads using get on my good side + heals.

Adding a energy nerf would be too over powered, but maybe reducing shield damage reduction could be helpful?, idk or something. Just a thought.


===   <i><b>Svarog PTW Buff</b></i>
1! - Damage +10%, Reload Speed + 20%
2? - PTW, range increases to 8km.

Explanation:
Svarog underperforms. This change would give it more of a niche advantage while keeping it balanced, allowing for more varied and effective user effectiveness in the game.



===   <i><b>Flechette Proj Speed</b></i>
1! - Increase projectile speed by 30%
2? - Only for artillery and tac cruiser

Explanation: They underperform and thus arent viable for defensive applications. this change would make them a more viable pick for classes like Arty and Tac Cruisers.



===   <i><b>Vultures Proj Speed</b></i>
1! - Increase proj speed by 15%

Explanation: They can still be the slowest, but not as slow.

nax
- no to shield debuff on rup cataluyst
+ to stabia ptw >> 70%

-+ wants no change to stasis ammo
-+ wants no change to grenada
+ to nevis short range damage (higher than mithras)
+ nevis ptw short higher than mithras (it would reflect based on short range dmg
+ flechetts speed buff
+ vulture MS slight speed buff

Stratoss
- no change to stasis ammo

lil
+ cancel function on stasis is fine, full cooldown
- wants no change to rup caty
- wants no change to grenada
+ tightening rup caty reload on stabia

+nevis ptw buff (over mithras)

Polaris
+ svarog ptw buff
+ svarog get 8km range ptw only
