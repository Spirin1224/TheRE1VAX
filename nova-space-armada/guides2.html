## How to best spend those resources (hint: on your fleet / ships)[](https://auth.fandom.com/signin?redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fnovaspacearmada.fandom.com%2Fwiki%2FBeginner_Guides%3Fveaction%3Dedit%26section%3D9&uselang=en "Sign in to edit")

Doing all the above daily will be necessary to build a good fleet. Early on you have limited admiral choices, but don't worry about that too much. Elena is a good tutorial commander that you can use to farm for better content for a while.

### Admirals[](https://auth.fandom.com/signin?redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fnovaspacearmada.fandom.com%2Fwiki%2FBeginner_Guides%3Fveaction%3Dedit%26section%3D10&uselang=en "Sign in to edit")

**Elena is a good starter admiral.** You will be fighting a lot of NPC scavengers. All of them have weapons that only deal 15% shield penetration (SP), so having shield units on your ships is effective at fighting them. Elena gives extra shield for her fleet (formation unlocks at admiral level 15, level your admiral), as well as even more extra shield for her Front formation row. Check the [Admiral list](https://novaspacearmada.fandom.com/wiki/Admiral_List "Admiral List") to understand where you can find more or better admirals later.

### Fleets[](https://auth.fandom.com/signin?redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fnovaspacearmada.fandom.com%2Fwiki%2FBeginner_Guides%3Fveaction%3Dedit%26section%3D11&uselang=en "Sign in to edit")

You will get more admirals and unlock more fleets as you progress. Don't spread your resources. Use standard (manufactured by you) ships and equipment to fill up the extra fleets. Pool all the upgrades and resources into your main fleet. Later on, when you get something better, you have the option to [destroy](https://novaspacearmada.fandom.com/wiki/Assembling_a_ship "Assembling a ship") the weaker item and get all of the upgrade materials back. So feel free to spend everything you have whenever you can.

It is also important to plan your fleets. Once you figured out which admirals you want to play with (pick only 2, you won't have resources for more), then the [Ship List](https://novaspacearmada.fandom.com/wiki/Ships_List "Ships List") can help you plan your future ship acquisitions.

### Ships[](https://auth.fandom.com/signin?redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fnovaspacearmada.fandom.com%2Fwiki%2FBeginner_Guides%3Fveaction%3Dedit%26section%3D12&uselang=en "Sign in to edit")

During your first login month, the daily reward will supply you with some sample ships and computers to rank them up fully. If you play actively and do the daily tasks mentioned above, you will have much better ships and fleet than the ones in these daily rewards.

- Byagoona FF: quite a versatile ship. Can be a Front row tank (high shields and damage reduction), as well as capable dps (accuracy bonuses). Use as tank for now, as the tank ship options are somewhat limited.
- Ctogga FF: similarly versatile as the Byagoona. We are going to use them as laser DPS ships. Put them in the Back row.
- [Puck](https://novaspacearmada.fandom.com/wiki/Puck "Puck") FF: your day 2 login bonus is a quite decent frigate, actually. Use it as flagship. The [Accuracy/Evasion](https://novaspacearmada.fandom.com/wiki/Accuracy_%26_Evasion "Accuracy & Evasion") mechanic plays a huge part in this game, and giving extra accuracy to the entire fleet helps the dps output.
- Dogoda DD: does not have a shield boost, but the damage reduction skill is useful in the Front row.
- Chthoninans DD: Can be used as Front row tank if you manage to get it to 2-3 stars for the shield boost. Otherwise use in Main row as dps (accuracy bonus).
- [Argo](https://novaspacearmada.fandom.com/wiki/Argo "Argo") DD: should you pull for this ship? This is a very good an early game ship, so whales will want 3 of these in their fleets. F2P can get 1 copy for the Gaia Manual passive stat boost bonuses.
- Pyxis DD: Capable as Front (high shields) tank or Main row dps.

### Equipment[](https://auth.fandom.com/signin?redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fnovaspacearmada.fandom.com%2Fwiki%2FBeginner_Guides%3Fveaction%3Dedit%26section%3D13&uselang=en "Sign in to edit")

Your best equipment will come from Black Market pulls at first. These will be the blue rate 65 items. These can be upgraded to lv20 with basic Fluid Layers and are equal to their lv11 rate 100 counterparts. Use rate 80 purple weapons as placeholders only. Destroy them for extra fluids and hyperfluids and only level your r65 and r100 above lv10.

#### Weapons[](https://auth.fandom.com/signin?redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fnovaspacearmada.fandom.com%2Fwiki%2FBeginner_Guides%3Fveaction%3Dedit%26section%3D14&uselang=en "Sign in to edit")

There are 3 weapon types in the game:

- **kinetic**: very fast rate of fire, very low accuracy, medium damage -> good mid and endgame choice, but only use on ships that have accuracy boosting skills (and equip extra accuracy units). E.g.: Puck, 3 star Byagoona FF
- **missile**: very slow rate of fire, medium accuracy, high damage -> can deal large amount of damage at once, but only if it hits. Only use on ships that provide other missile related bonuses as well. E.g.: Posvist CL, 3 star Byagoona FF, etc
- **laser**: medium rate of fire, very high accuracy, low damage -> the high accuracy will give you a damage bonus early game. Use on ships with other damage boosting skills and no weapon preferance. E.g.: Ctoggha FF, Chthoninans DD, Demeter FF, etc.

#### Armor[](https://auth.fandom.com/signin?redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fnovaspacearmada.fandom.com%2Fwiki%2FBeginner_Guides%3Fveaction%3Dedit%26section%3D15&uselang=en "Sign in to edit")

There are 2 flavors: [armor and resistance](https://novaspacearmada.fandom.com/wiki/Armor_%26_Resistance "Armor & Resistance")

- armor: reduces damage to HP. Early on you will probably use only this type.
- resistance: reduces damage to HP and Shield against a specific weapon type only. Some ship hulls will provide some extra resistance when leveling them up, but early on don't worry too much about this. Use the armor type till you get higher rate equipment (r100)

#### Units[](https://auth.fandom.com/signin?redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fnovaspacearmada.fandom.com%2Fwiki%2FBeginner_Guides%3Fveaction%3Dedit%26section%3D16&uselang=en "Sign in to edit")

As mentioned above, your early unit choice will be the shield on almost every ship (for lack of anything else). Use your few accuracy units on your damage ships (like the Puck or the Desolate Nesoi, once you get it from exploration). Don't bother with resistance type equipment for now.

#### Engine[](https://auth.fandom.com/signin?redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fnovaspacearmada.fandom.com%2Fwiki%2FBeginner_Guides%3Fveaction%3Dedit%26section%3D17&uselang=en "Sign in to edit")

Always use the best one you can get your hands on. Note that some purple engines can be farmed in deep space exploration as well. You probably won't need to do this though. If you find yourself in need of more energy than what your best engine can provide, you will want to equip a reactor unit in one of your unit slots.

Research:

Research is divided into 4 categories (3 if pre-matrix)

Ship Research Path
Blueprint Research Path
Matrix Research Path

**-Research** 
-Quantum Computer – this is very important as it speeds up your research time want to get this to lvl 50 sooner rather than later 
-Persistent Scholar – lowers the cost of research important for conserving Rc want it max or at least lvl 40 
-Mechanical Engineering System – lowers cost of station structures not super important but nice for saving resources 

-PvP research Prioritization 
1. Normal Accuracy/Evade > 
2. Command Link > 
3. Parallel Machine / Maintenance Equipment > 
4. Advanced Engagement / Nano Plate / Complex Hull / Dimensional Ballistics > 
5. Anti-Impact / Anti-Missile > 
6. Hyper Energy Theory > 
7. Cruiser Hull Imp... / 
8. Battleship Hull Imp... / 
9. Dread Hull Imp... > 
10. Anti Laser Shield > 
11. Destroyer Hull Imp... 

Matrix Prioritization – 
1. Damage (Rear > Main > Flag > Front) > 
2. Defense (Rear > Front > Flag > Main) > 
3. Production Line optimization / Defense Damage control > 
4. Space Exploring Theory
