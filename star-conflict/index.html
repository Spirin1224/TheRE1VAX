Marten is my favorite ship in the game.
Tactics and Thoughts:
Wormhole Stabilizer:
Instant teleport is a serious advantage, especially against an enemy.
-
IR Ammo: Easier to hit enemies in a turn fight, allows aiming blind, can help doppler theory. (Perceived DPS increase when moving in direction of projectile.)
-
Slowing Missiles and Mines

Spike:
Quick Tactics, Thoughts and Strategies:
[[Build is outdated!!!]]
Doppler Laser buff works with strafe speed as well. Possible to maintain 25% damage buff just by strafing. Strafing allows buff at low overall speeds.
-
Many good combinations of active modules exist for spike. Experiment and use them for your own build and needs.
-
EBM good for lazy interceptors, command fighters, groups of people, and destroyers.
-
White Noise Jammer. Very helpful when fighting ECM’s. Don’t brush it off.
-
Pirate Orion Targeting Complex does higher total damage than mk5 OTC

Kirishima SH/\RP Guide - TheRE1VAX
—

Its not gonna be great, but its not gonna be long.

—

Kirishima.
R17 Jeri Command Fighter.

—

What I am describing is my playstyle and thus build for it. Take what you can or would like to, this is what I use it for and what it means to me.

—

Kirishima - SH/\RP

Long range firepower
Ally support

—

Sower weapon is good at long ranges. What unlocked its effectiveness for me is high ROF and spikes of mines (using Shared Cooler).

This is also true because holding down the trigger too long increases spread and for certain targets this means its hard to hit them.

High range, effective vs Destroyers and Frigates. This is also true of Guard Frigates.

—

Explaining module selection.

And why spec mod.

Special Module allows you to make your allies invincible for a short time, which can be helpful in a variety of situations.

Solo it is more effective than regular shield.

Yes, there are bugs, but in my experience watch your range and be selective on who and if you have allies in range.

—
—

It excels by itself or with allies.

Thankfully close on allied defence/offence is good because it means enemies are close range enough to suck energy out of them to feed spec mod and keep allies invincible. Of course they also benefit from Command modules (Aegis).

And more than that, this means you can redirect ally damage into EC and have temporary very high damage for a time against an enemy.

This is what it is fun.
Spec mod, energy drainer, EC = punishment for those that touch your friends.

And you can swap sower and maybe do a crit railgun build for close range pummeling, but that might also require other changes such as taking Valkyre.
(Good pilgrim build ofc).

—

I keep shield booster for obvious reasons.

—

And that’s it. Kirishima SH/\RP.
Close range ally defense.
Long range offense firepower.

- REG/-\LITY
Looks cool, and is that it?

Pretty much.

...

Still here?
You like making broken things work?

-REG/-\LITY
Its fun, and in moderate circumstances quite servivable.


Features:
When done and in proper circumstances, is quite survivable.
Right loadout, a  mildly effective nuisance.
Can deal with close quarters deterents.
Has module flexibility to better support allies.
Not terrible speed.
Not terrible range.
Not terrible damage.

SpecMod - Adaptive Restoration System:
Receiving damage gives you a counter, every counter adds +15 passive resists.
Getting 10 counters = 150 passive resists.

Catch!
Counter clears after 30 seconds. Upon reaching max stack (10) counter will reset after 40 seconds.

The goal is simple, have close to max shield while having maximum counters.
Supplementing and floating damage by using shield booster and having high shield regeneration can facilitate this.

Tactics::
-OnFire Shield Conversion:
IF
If you have most of your shield health
And are taking a lot of damage
and EXPECT to take a lot of damage.

Activate the module under fire.

This will give you the shield, and the damage will quickly reset it to 10.
In fire, this can end up protecting your regenerated shield. And can allow you to regen a full 10 stack every cooldown.

-

Using it on spawn is a good way to get moving.

Protazan - 'VALENCE'

Think of 'VALENCE' like a mini Relic. Pot shots at fighters and interceptors. Good at long-medium range.

Valence boasts high effectivness vs (again), fighters, interceptors, and frigates. Pirate Cannon allows high effectiveness for in-field use, and this is especially true using Prota unique mod.

And for anything that needs more help, finish with Storm-D. Jump and cloak at your disposal to keep yourself in the right position, getting in range of enemies, and out of range of their attention. Multiphase allows tanking of damage while you hopefully jump to a safer place.

Quick Tips:
Strafing works well in this ship, use it to help leading shots. (as well as rolling of course).
Keep an eye on range.

"Variacent" -- Relic, R17, Jericho Destroyer

Primary Function:: Long Range Blockade/Support.

For those that don't know or understand Relic, it is an adept Jericho destroyer.
Its primarily built for defense and has high effectiveness vs long range slow targets.

Which any destroyer is good against, which makes Relic default loadout kind of niche.

Consider that Tyrant is much more offensive than its higher counterpart, what does Relic offer?

--
Forward: Relic - The most defensive destroyer.
--

[SpecMod] Reflecting Shield.
Everyone knows what it does. Makes a large shield outside of the ship that bounces non piercing projectiles back to enemy and gives 400shields resists internally when active.

This is what makes the Relic quite defendable, especially against other destroyers such as Zeta Pburster or Emperor (and of course many others). It highly discourages focus fire and can effectively float over high alpha attacks at medium range+.

I will be making use of this in this build--as it serves as a blockade function.

----
--The Build Itself
----

Relic was and perhaps and still is known for its 'fireworks', but im not going to focus on that for this build.

No, just as Tyrant is primarily a weapons build -- so too this will be.

The key is increasing projectile speed, and absolutely trounce most anything from frigates down. High weapon alpha is noted in this build.

Single taps, lazy aiming (free aiming) on anything at range makes this niche destroyer and niche build quite effective in a lot of situations.

Combine this with AOE spammy modules allows you to influence large portions of the map at medium ranges.


While reflecting shield, high shield resistance and regen allow this to tank a lot of damage from multiple sources--at range or close by.


-- more considerations
Considering this is clearly a alpha based per-shot weapon,
you woould imagine that crits would work well, and no doubt if you could regularly pull crits in this high alpha build then perhaps so.

Thq question is a few things, and its
1. is it worth it?

and thats about it.

G2 has practically no internal crit chance.

So.  How to get crits?
crew,
modifiers,
and ammo,

problem.
You need projectile speed to hit small/fast targets.
you get that (from against crits) from ammo.

now if you can get away with 9240 proj speed, then be my guest.
and it might be a doable build.

other problem:
balancing modifiers.

you have to pull from something to slot 3 cpu slots,
1 for horizon,
and 2 for crit chance.

-

is it potentially worth it?
without ammo,
we are at 25% crit chance at 50% crit dmg.
lowering speed we are at 35% crit chance at 50% crit dmg
or, flip flop and use crew,
25% crit chance and 80% crit dmg.

thats an effective 20% dmg increase. (averaged out).

-

i mean, for fun,
lets just go pure crits.

(keeping horizon)
45% crit chance 80% crit dmg
==36% effective dmg.
BUT because it is a tap weapon, that could result in some major tap-outs.

problem is you are losing all your projectile speed.

3600 base alpha or so
thats like 6480 on crit.

-

i mean
lose a em barrier
lose regen coating

bam, 2 cpu slots.

the problem again is projectile speed.

keeping pulse discharger x2
4490 alpha dmg *1.8 crit
8082 alpha dmg closest range.
average kinetic hull resists are 20% or so
6465.6 alpha dmg, near sight.

on a crit mind you, which at 45% chance is every other shot.
that doesnt sound bad (crit doesnt work at every other shot)

the NICE thing is that since there are so many turrets it may help in distributing the crit chance and give a more average number.

i mean.

if you sacrifice range.

what can we get away with?

maybe...
you need at least one item for proj speed
for that you either sacrifice 10% crit chance
or 30% crit dmg
sacrifice the ammo, throw on yet another crit chance.
so you have like what, 3???

i mean, its ugly
but its theoretically possible.

24
10
5
39% crit chance at 80% crit dmg.
not bad.
4490

ya got 9 slots.
i don't need shield cap so thats one.
we need one more.
and we have to think about energy.
especially with photon emitter.

either sacrifice crew, or modifier for energy.
can switch shield regen crew for energy when standstill
and sacrifice modifier
or keep 
1. lose shield regen and get energy to free up modifier
2. run without???

current energy regen is 308s

-

and hold on a second.
cuz look, every 10% of crit is like 5% dmg.
so like with 100% crit chance, every 10% of crit dmg is 10% more dmg.
this works backwards in math not neccesarily in actual gameplay.

i didn't want to lose 30% crew dmg modifier.
but.
this accomplishes a few things
1. ammo nerfs dmg by 10% (which can negate some of what we gain from crits)
2. crew does not

so.
in the end, we lose 10% crit dmg from using crew to modifier.
but DON'T lose 10% dmg from ammo.
AND, not lose another 10% of modifier effectiveness instead of running 3x cpu.

so its like
 speed from crew 6:3
 crit ammo
 2x crit modifier
 1x targeting 20% crit dmg
19.8
10
10
5
45% crit chance, 70% crit dmg, without losing 10% alpha.

major problem, is range.
lose one for horizon
and get 35%crit chance and 70% crit dmg?
not easy to balance.

in the end, we can thus stand to lose a pulse discharger and swap for energy regen, and be able to free hull slot.

-
i mean for range
you are gonna lose 10% crit for range either way
remember the maximum crit you can do is 
24 (3x modifiers)
34
44

49% anyhow, with full crew and modifiers and ammo.

i mean, its not pretty any way you dice it.
if you wanna keep any proj speed.

lose ammo, but get back 80% alpha,
but lose 10% dmg!

70>80% crit dmg, lose 10% alpha
i mean, its slightly better to do mixed,
get the crit from modifiers, and swap from ammo
minimize loss with 3x crit chance modifiers.

at any rate, you lose horizon if you do that.


-
i mean its like 6k base range.
is that doable? sure.

so, best final build
8250 base proj speed
[[assume 4k base alpha]]


-- option 1
crew 2:1 = 10% crit chance
crew 6:3 = 30% proj speed
2x crit chance modules = 18% crit chance
1x targeting coprocessor = 20% crit dmg
-
10725 proj speed
33% crit chance 70% crit dmg
4000
33 * 70 / 100 = 23.1% average dps increase
4000 * 23.1 = 4925 dps ish


-- option 2
crew 2:1 = 10% crit chance
crew 6:2 = 30% crit dmg
speed ammo
3x crit chance modules  = 24% crit chance
5% base crit chance
-
10972.5 proj speed
39% crit chance, 80% crit dmg.
3600 (-10% alpha)
39 * 80 / 100 = 31.2% average dps increase.
3600 * 1.312 = 4723.2 damage modifier increase ish?

-in the end

running a crit build like this means losing out on any range
3 modules slots
and a few crew slots.
for 23-30% more average dmg.

30% more damage or 60% more range?
part of the problem is that you have to factor in perhaps the whole build, because you can thus weigh if just using pulse discharger and 

like, are those 3 modifier slots worth it??
can you run pulse and a crit build?

i mean. just 3 pulse dischargers is 24% more damage, with no crew nonsense BUT with -30% energy regen.
still can keep range in any case and projectile speed.
i mean, heck gain 7.4% using ammo. call it a day.

262 base energy
- 30%
183.4 energy. whee.

--

mmmmm, this all sorta sucks.
improving the floor of alpha is not a bad idea
and dual speed ammo really can help shooting at farther ranges more accurately, again every 1km is 1500 dmg.

thats far more effective than an average of 30% more damage.
1500 dmg per km?, thats like 28% dmg increase from base.
i mean. thats quite something.

how does proj speed work?
i imagien have 30% more proj speed is a 30% shorter lead marker to shoot at
or like 30% farther at the same displacement?
im sure something somewhere is like that.
if so. 30% of the range being same marker.
thats like how many km?i
if you can shoot fine at 5km and its 60%
its like 40%
so like shoot at 5km like i can at 2km.
without proj speed i can like what twice as much range?
so thats like 3000 over 4000, thats like 75% more dmg.

its very ugly, but i know there is logic to say this is correct at some scale. even if the numbers are wrong.

-on with improving my build
i want as much alpha as i can get optimally while keeping proj speed.
11:a (average like what 8%?)
12:a +7%
15:a 3%
like 18% more damage from crew.
26% alpha from modifiers if i did all pulse dischargers.
= 44% more alpha.
from 4200 (seems closer)
6048

and well, i could sacrifice something somewhere for dmg for proj speed. it just depends on the scale of what deflection?

like pretend im right and 30% proj speed is 30% shorter lead marker,
if thats already very short, then you can barely tell.
its about the scale of it in the first place.

still

from 0 >> 60% faster proj speed is a 60% deficit in aiming reticle distance. if im right.

look in the end
2x pulse  = 19.8% dmg
3x pulse = 26.4% dmg
thats 7% dmg.

-
comparing my current build?
thats like 20% ish on the table.
if i dropped crew shield regen that 7% not moving
3% from 15
and 8-12% from 11:a, which you should do anyway.
i want proj speed so I will not grab the 7% from the crew
and there is another 7% from pulse discharger
so thats 14% more alpha im not grabbing potentially.

right now,
4490.
4490 * 1.2 = 5388
5388 * 1.14 = 6142.32 = 754 dmg i could gain.
ofc, i gain twice that from every km of range.
if i gain 2km of good range from speed thats 3000 more potential alpha dmg.
so pretend
5388*1.07 5765.16 = 377 dmg im missing out on.

its just not worth the extra mile
and thats with losing another 7 or 10% energy regen when i already don't have much. and i could keep shields.

-

consider that the average kinetic shield restsitance is 50pts or so, 34% reduction.
45pts is 31%
-10pts is?
22 pts is 18%
its like 31% to like 25%
so like a 5% resist so like what 5% dmg increase?
it gets higher the less resistance they have above 0.
like 20 or so is best., not like any other crew is good there anyhow.

i mean, you wont ever touch something thats like having 10% more dmg.
+7pts from 45 is only 3% more resistance.
i mean, its a 30% ish delta from 7>10
so like 4.5%? i knnow its not how it works its all very dirty ish.
still, like 4.5% subtraction from their damage reduction.
4.5% dmg increase. whee.

in the end it doesnt matter too much. we all make choices.

you can lose all of this by missing one shot. puts it into perspective. how important the dmg is.
and every % over base you get, is a lower delta than the first.

1>20 is high delta
70>80% is lower delta than like
20>30% delta.

 


--dmg ramp
3202 range to distribute 11k dmg.
thats like 3600dmg every 1000m?
i lied

starts at 2500m, goes to max is 9607
7107 range to distribute 11197
thats like 1.57 dmg per meter?
1570dmg per 1km?
seems about right.
hm. interesting. math checks out
4490+(1570*[# of kilometers until max dmg*])
which matches at 7 times (7km), which is close enough to 9607-2500m

-- more notes
now that using the shield regenerates 500 shield per second.
you might not have to run a shield regen.
well.

ma is 10s, so maximum is 5000 shield regen.
i know i know, everyone says passive doesnt work cuz energy or whatever.
still.
current build is 732 base.
732*1.4 = 1024.8 shields a SECOND.
passively.

so.

Its the best I think i can create in my playstyle.
It is hard, it is finicky, but it has nearly every tool to handle nearly every situation.

Weaknesses:
You must understand distance to enemies. Skirt around and maintain a perimeter.

Close in only when you are sure you are orientated correctly, and you can finish it quickly. if it isnt quick, it isnt worth it.

Sniper LRFs become priority when they appear. This is Tyrants biggest vulnerability if undealt with.


Playstyle Advantages:
Keep moving. You have high resistances with adaptive shield if you keep moving, and build enhanced immunity to EM damage.
Dont neglect your Adaptive Shield.
Use all your modules and plan in advance.

Be patient. Dont spam afterburner, conserve energy. Dont plan for the single attack, but understand where you are going.

You have a deft hand, and tactical patience, you will truly be a Tyrant.

--New Tyrant Guide
\/-\L0ROUS
Tyrant used to be a close range brawler, and it still is.
Add another level of 'edge' to it.
And that is what this is now.

Adding wormhole ++ WR opens up very helpful opportunities.
Allowing Tyrant to become anti interceptor, and anti destroyer.



--more about Tyrant
oh yeah, this thing is on another level nowadays.
Extremely potent. The crit chance increase ++ more projectile speed = a rocking ship.

Think like pounding mid-range relic.

And consider its range is already 6km!


--
another update!
so for some odd reason!!! XD
they buffed Thermoactive again!!! WHY!?
50%>75% crit dmg. so like. sure.

Tyrant Destroyer Advanced Guide
-TheRE1\/-\><


Overview:
This guide is a advanced tactics and strategy guide for Tyrant. It covers primarily overral build and use strategies and tactics. This can be taken as itself or as extra information for your builds, playstyles, and information.



--
-[Summary]
-Tyrant, R14 Jericho Destroyer
--

Tyrant.
A name that impresses all players from the moment they hear it to the moment they see it.
Especially in more classic Star Conflict PVP the Tyrant was a destroyer to be feared. When in the hands of dedicated players, it truly played and lived up to its name -- a Tyrant.

This Jericho destroyer offers interesting gameplay abilities and tactics, rewarding skill, a tactical mind, timing, and strategy from the build, to the field.

This ship is highly technical.
Its modules, special components, Jericho buffs augment the concept that it responds very well to again, the tactical mind. To putting forth thought and effort into building and using it. Those who do so will get the most out of it.

Summary:
It is (supposed to be/often) a close ranged veritable brawler, capable (in the right hands with the right build) of taking on everything. From small agile interceptors, to being a destroyer destroyer.


A few general major points.
(Based on using its special abilities and modules).
-Destroying any enemy in a short range heals your shield
-A mine that benefits by damaging enemies in a close group at medium range.
-An onboard converter converts received damage to charges that can damage a targeted enemy in a short range while partially restoring shield.

This ends the brief summary.


--Upcoming Sections
This guide will be divided into sections.
-Personal Thoughts on builds
-Builds

Using
-General Strategies(and advanced)
-Tactics (and advanced)
-Other(?)





--
-Tyrant - Builds
--

--Forward
As stated in the summary, this is a highly technical ship platform. It allows for different types of build directions and gameplay(based on the build of course).

Even though this guide is split, build from playstyle, it is what you the player wants that makes this work. Build and playstyle of course synergize together. The goal is based from the playstyle, and enabling your playstyle is from the build. The build enables certain playstyles.

As that is, it is my opinion there are many viable different builds and playstyles to this ship.

This, of course, is where many disagree with this concept, often citing that there is the meta and only the meta. Why consider what is not meta?

[META
Most Effective Tactic(in general) Available]


Based on that concept, I could show you what the community feels is THE and thus the BEST Tyrant build. Which I will do(somewhere at the very end)[maybe?].

I would always take claims about a perfect meta build, especially in a ship like this, with a grain of salt.
Different goals, comfort levels, and the changing pvp landscape make the META a moving target when it comes down to per-user and per-goal and even per-situation.

-

With this in mind, I will be discussing different builds/playstyles and their advantages and disadvantages.

(Remember. Opinion. (Although a opinion based on evidence and objective(and subjective) thought and comparisons.)


Lets get into it!


--Builds
As with any R14 Destroyer, what often serves as the foundation of the build is the slots you choose from it.

In concepts, this stems from two decisions the user makes.

1. What is the main weapon?
2. Modules and Play/Build Style

Both of these support the users playstyle or goal.

So
Why like that and in that order?
Often the weapon dictates the main feel of the ship. And also it is of high importance to make main weapon usable or comfortable, and this requires slots. A meson build would take 2 or 3 cpu slots, a good Thermo build may take just two perhaps, another may only need 1 cpu for horizon.

Usually then you decide the rest of the build with what is available, often because the primary weapon is of higher importance.

In actuality, both are being applied before building slots, its just often the order of logic. Any user considers (and often has in mind) what he or she wants before building slots.


--weapon build ideas

:: Thermoactive Zenith Build
Thermoactive weapon is, in my opinion, the best and perhaps the highest potential weapon for Tyrant.

The weapon, as you likely know, increases critical chance as it heats up. Maintaining a level high on the heat meter requires trigger discipline, forethought, skill, and patience (among other generalized qualities).

This is my build. It has the following advantages...
- Projectile speed to hit interceptors
- High dps
- High critical damage (correlates with dps)
- Good range.

Often the things to balance are projectile speed and crit chance/damage. I believe my build is not only objectively optimal but it is also very comfortable to me, and thus subjectively the best (for the weapon in my playstyle).

It is mainly from the following:
Crew 2:A
Crew 6:C
Crew 11:A (or B)
Two Crit Dmg Modules
Horizon Module

"Why not crew for crit dmg and replace one of the crit dmg for crit chance?"

Because projectile speed is worth it.(in my playstyle).

If I can't hit targets, it doesn’t matter if I have a million alpha damage.

I also don’t really lose much without the crit chance module, its better to use weapon correctly to maintain higher crit chance. Better reward efficient usage of Thermoactive.
You could trade proj speed for crit dmg and have <70% crit chance for 121% crit damage. Be a kickin build. (I may consider doing that and seeing if its worth it but not being able to hit certain targets.)

Remember: Higher projectile speeds help enable horizon for smaller/faster targets. The farther the distance the more dramatic the aiming offset. 
Thus, I can still be accurate at longer ranges, which is more time on target, higher effectiveness, greater efficiency of time, and thus a more optimal configuration.


-calculating nominal critical hit dps increase.
What is the dps if we include crit chance and crit dmg?

Crit chance is represented as a percentage, or out of 100

Posted build stats.
5525 dps
70% crit chance
91% crit dmg

Multiply crit chance by crit dmg.
70*91=6370
since it is a percentage, divide it by 100
6370/100=63.7% more damage.
This is our damage multiplier.
5525*1.63= 9005 dps at nominal 70% crit chance.

Quick note: What if I traded proj speed for an extra 30% crit damage?

70*121=8470/100=84.7%
5525*1.84=10166 dps.

-Modules
--

This is where personal preference can come more into play. Different playstyles, range builds, combinations and much more can vary.

And while the community will undoubtedly reccommend a end-all be-all 'META' build, 

I've had success doing things differently, often to my preference. 

Sometimes that leads to the exact same 'META' build, and sometimes its slightly different, sometimes its absolutely different. 

<i>What is important is what is comfortable and what works for you. Often what you are more comfortable or are better at using can offset or even go higher than the 'META' build (if one truly exists).</i>

[[This will be copy and pasted for the Ship Build section mind you.]]


With that stated, let's get into some module ideas, strategies, concepts, and considerations.

-
-


Isotope Harvester:
I highly recommend as a must have.
"Well dur TheR."

--Strategies, Tactics, and Tips
-Can be used to get around corners
-Activate at a close object to spawn it closer to you, allowing you to damage a closer enemy (who may other wise dodge the slow moving field).
-Fire it when you see trouble coming.
-Fire it leading a target, such as a destroyer, so that by the time the field gets in distance range it will hit the enemy craft.
-It is quite effective vs destroyers.

They added a 1.25 total multiplier.
Why?, idk, but it has that so its even more OP.

This module is your primary lifeline of shield (at least in my build and in my opinion).

Use it wisely. A wise use can potentially heal half of your shield instantly. Using it effectively is what will enable you to outlast even a number of powerful enemies.

--Multiphase Shield Generator
I highly recommend as a must have.
"Again. Dur theR."

-Strategies Tactics and Tips
I know it is obvious. This is very important for all Jericho Destroyers and greatly increases your shield resistance. Shield resistances is essentially both the efficiency and effectivness of your shield.
As I will discuss later, Tyrant is geared towards regeneration in modules, which means you should focus on resistance and capacity for the build (and in general.)

(You should go for all of those in general, this is nothing new.)

It is a active module. And please understand.

Correct and wise usage of this module can be the difference between losing >50-80% of your shield, to your enemy wondering if their hits even registered. 

Don’t waste it. 

Either by using it too much or too little.

It also counts as a multipurpose module, so it is helpful for clearing debuffs.(This becomes more relevant with my playstyle.)



-Photon Emitter
Cited as a 'must have' for all destroyers by the community.

Nowadays, considering the pvp scene, I also tend to agree with them. It is certainly useful in a variety of situations, especially as the common meta is other destroyers.

It also has a unique synergy with Tyrant. You can fire it at a nearby object and damage yourself, which will charge your special module.

It also is a very effective module vs other destroyers, allowing this build to be more of a potential dessie killer.
 

-[Fourth Slot]
Some prefer wormhole, other prefer gravitational-lens, others prefer repelling beam. Tempest is meh, and most people think pyro is meh.

Wormhole: helpful for getting in and out of combat, helpful when getting swarmed by ships, or the sneak-attacking covert ops. Does some damage projectile as well.

Repelling Beam:
I personally like Repelling beam, because it keeps them at just the right range for my primaries. (has other uses also).

Pyro:
Another choice I liked for a while. it is surprisingly effective at orbiting inties and at medium ranges vs fighters. Close range against enemy dessies can also work rather well.


-

Missile slot
Shields, hull heal, or repelling drone.

Many pro players swear by repelling beam, and as far as I am concerned is described as the meta (although it varies per ship). Is overpowered (especially when it was untargetable and therefore hard to disable).

Shields:
My personal favorite. Allows to soak up damage, make players flank you, among other uses. This is what I use and I recommend.

--
--
--



--
-Playstyle
--

How this works:
I am going to describe some playstyle concepts and styles that Tyrant favors, and then my in-depth playstyle(s).

--

General Concepts(as an opinion).
To a degree, strategizing placement is essential to staying alive. Reading the map and making choices. Often deciding between where to apply damage, and what will also not put you in a sitatuon where you can't run and you won't live.

-Tyrant Favor
Tyrant favors close-mid range fighting. In this concept, rotation speed, accel, and top speed (in order of importance) help to make this strategy effective. Moving around enemy dessies, keeping Spec Mod active, and picking right time for your modules while spec passive steals from those destroyed in close range to you...

all while battering them with Thermo-Active. 


Close on offense, far on defense.

Note: It can become quite a handful to do all these at once.


--my playstyle
It's essentially what I have already talked about.

Close on offense, far on defense. I typically try and circle the border between teams, around the left and right sides of the typical map. Staying relatively close to allies also helps.

Also, always and I mean always moving. This helps to mitigate/deter any cov ops and such stalking you. And enables your adaptive shields.

When it comes to fighting dessies, you have to either commit or toe the line to not get drained to death. Albireo has infinite lives, you do not. 3 dessies vs you at long range at sustained time = most likely death. [[Remember: You are not Relic.]]

You need to be close to get around shields, use spec mod, and spec active mod, and also spec passive mod.

Pounding with thermo at close range is when it gets effective.

And since this build is combat regen based, you need combat. My relic build is mid-close range high regen. (among other things).

It is certainly a hands-on ship.

This completes the main guide.
Tyrant may yet still have a place in this game (albiet in niche situations), but when it does it is both effective and thoroughly enjoyable.

'SENTIENCE' - Singularity
Guide and Build
-TheR

Preface:
Singularity...
Though the general pvp concensus is mixed,
("Com said this ship sucks in pvp")

I love the ship, and have had some success in using it.
-/


What I love about this ship and this build,
is its reliability and potential.

The main focus of this build is Accelerator Gun.
This weapon boasts a few key features.
1. Each landed shot increases projectile speed.
2. Good alpha damage.
3. Very good crit package.

This weapon is very balance. Almost perfect really.

When it comes to hitting small ships you want a balance between alpha and ROF.
Although, in small ships it is better to have higher alpha.
Easy to aim correctly once, then trying to constantly track a small ship (at any sort of range).

Too low ROF = miss the shots you take and potentially deal little damage. Don't have to ROF to take the shot at a good firing solution.
Too high ROF = typically is balanced by low alpha. Make 60% of the shots, but deal very little damage.

This weapon not only has the right combo of ROF and alpha for hitting smaller targets.
But the single fact that it fires all projectiles at once (and keeping the balanced ROF/ALPHA) makes it nigh perfect.
This is especially true for a crit build, as it ensures all 4 projectiles hit together, rewarding alpha rather than ROF,
and ALPHA is the multiplier for crits.

-

The weapon (in this build especially) is thus incredibly balanced. Very good solid reliable damage, from good range.


--
The build isnt special, its rather straightforward.
Use modules wisely. Swap EC for shield booster if you want the extra survivability.

--
Special modules is still unique. Allows for infinite cloak, doesnt disengage when taking damage, and has a rather low cooldown.
This is balanced with slower module reload and basically no shield regen.

This leads to playstyle for this build.

--
--Playstyle
--

One of the biggest complaints, and is a newb trap, is to simply stay cloaked most of the match.

So instead consider this (how i play it).

--
Walk around uncloaked.
This keeps your cloak spared, baits EC, and allows you to help allies in general.

When you take focused damage, cloak as you would, but instead of staying in cloaked till next target,
dont.
Find allies, or cover, distance, etc.. uncloak.
Continue walking.

This allows shield regen part of the build to work, and allows modules to be ready.

--

This ship is passively effective! With little effort you can reliably engage a multitude of targets, from inties to fighters, to frigates (yes the damage is good enough to be worth helping), and at close range perhaps with EC, some dessies. (ish, not really in this meta still.)

As in, the main weapon, the ships damage, is its main weapon. And its straightforward and reliable to use. Maximize its time in effective use.
Cloak when you need to.

--
--notes
--

Positioning and timing are big things. Try to engage a target either with allies, or catching them retreating or alone.
Obviously if you come out of cloak, and its a tharga // wolfhound, your gonna die.
So try and 'walk' over there, keeping an eye on cooldowns. Or better yet, stay in cloak longer, wait for it to be reset, come out of cloak.
doesnt work, recloak.

Always be smart around fast targets trying to nab you. Cloak early, a quick fighter may Particle Purge you out of the sky if you arent careful.

'VIZIANT' - Vigilant, R14 Empire Suppressor Class Destroyer


Description:
VIZIANT, a loadout and build for the Empire Destroyer Vigilant.
The build focuses on the tankiness of Vigilant and the damage of the Vacuum Resonance Laser.
This build offers extreme effectiveness in medium to long range engagements against many targets, as well as offering support for the team.


Strengths:
High tank factor and survivability.
High effectivess in medium-long ranges.
Area denial, beacon denial, ally support.


Weaknesses:
Notably weak in short ranges.
Very low mobility.
Regeneration is not high.
Weak vs. other Destroyers due to low mobility.


The Build::
This is a Laser range build, using thermal damage and mines to supply denial to an area and high damage to targets.


-Spatial Stabilizer-

This build offers extreme damage to targets around 7km range.
Very effective against fighters and frigates, can be effective vs interceptors (more so than typical destroyer weapons at range).

However the effectiveness is dependent on being in one place, which is not good for defensive when being attacked. Thankfully VIZIANT has very high one-way survivability and high range, allowing it to stay out of the direct heat if the battle and augment ally position or deny an open area of space or even play beacon defense.


Modules:
Pyro Emitter/Photon Emitter
Remote Mine Layer
Gravitational Lense
(Close Range Defense) Repelling Beam, Crystalline Suppressor, or a turret.



-Dealing With Interceptors and Fighter rushes-

Vulnerability Scanner does allow Vigilant to deal with close range targets.
This, combined with Remote Mine Layer at close range, can allow dealing with enemy ships.



-  <<< Gameplay/Playstyle >>>  -
VIZIANT is designed to be an actual suppression destroyer build, and the playstyle very much reflects this.

Your job is simple, and it is mainly area denial.
--Primary: Area suppresion and denial by long range effective weaponry.
--Secondary: Providing beacon support (if applicable) and Ally support in main territory.

As such, primary position is on the left or right flanks of ally territory stemming into middle-no-mans-land.
This provides you the ability to typically control a third of open airspace with an overpowered 7.7km Vaccuum Resonance Laser.

Kusarigama
SHRAPNEL

This ship is very interesting.
With my build or playstyle, I note three things.

1. Extreme effectiveness vs Destroyers (obvious)
2. easy to pick up kills
3. High effectiveness vs Interceptors.

Its true Punisher only homes 4 projectiles, and thus do little damage.
But with OTC, you can finish off most of all low health interceptors. That is incredibly useful.

Its kinda a neat ship, that most of the time is kinda meh, but sometimes can get in the groove of finishing certain ships.

Punisher at close ranges (and a crit) does two shot damage. Sneaking up on interceptors, or fighters (like right on them) + OTC = 80% of their health. This is hard to do as the weapon is extra finicky at close ranges.

The weapon ofc is good against frigate hulls.

Spec Mod:
It sucks tbh. Its alright in scaring people, in taking out drones (especially Albireo drones), but the damage on a person is very very low. Even in a group the actual damage is still not punishing enough.

Its fine to slot, has niche uses, but you would be just fine with regular web.

Only other thing, it works at ranges. Don't need a lock on, that can be quite useful.

Irbis is the newest Federation tackler, and it is quite impressive.

This is a Rails build, I havent yet posted the regular build (with the special weapon).

Make sure to lock on, and ofc tap.
Aim assist is absolutely ridiculous in this. You will find high effectiveness vs interceptors,
ive tracked down 2 albireos (in intie form) that were cloaked, and destroyed them both. First time ive ever done that (without using AOE or getting help).

Don't underestimate cloak for attacking targets, and even using it to get around the map.
Feel free to swap out a few modules if you need target painter and target inhibitor.

Oh and the crew is your guess atm cuz i cant be bothered to include it.

<div class="EA_Content">
Everyone says Ignis sucks. And they aren't necesarily wrong.

But with the right build, the right playstyle,
the right situation, and the right player.

It is a <b>LOT</b> of fun.

--

The posted build should already describe a lot for you.

When you decide to do a rush, you will be doing a lot of damage.

It is right in the middle of a strafe and a rotation build. This allows you to get more time on target during the rush, while maintaining effectiveness at orbit range.

If you want more damage, then swap out Supercooled for Supernova, be warned that this will make it hard to be helpful at range, considering this is a crit build and Ignis already has proj speed problems.

As you well know, higher ROF increases or rather, distributes crit chance correctly. You will better feel dmg increase from crits with higher ROF. This explains why use Wounded Beast (among other reasons) and crew 11:B (and yes this is obvious, but also on purpose).

--

High effectivness vs interceptors, fighters, multiple targets, and cloaked people.

I decided against running a Particle Purge build, because I need the modules it already has, and cuz I need speed.(or i am lazy.. your pick.)

Lacks a lot of alpha vs dessies, and lacks alpha for frigates...
although you can take out a frigate by yourself if you have time.

<div class="EA_Content">
Do you like Wolfhound?
Do you like Lasers? (Preferably Ion Emitter)
Do you like having fun even if you lose?
Do you like high skill builds?

Then this should be fun.

It is pretty self explanatory.

Notes:
Know when to be say 3 clicks from fully zoomed in.
(as in, fully zoom in, unclick the zoom, two more clicks (scroll wheel clicks) and thats about the optimum distance)*
* of course, its individual and per resolutin.

Just know that sitting closer on the ship helps with aiming, and ofc zoom out when orbiting (if thats also your thing).

Thinking about a crit build with it, but ill come back to that later.</div>

<div class="EA_Content">

Spiral is a neat ship, one of the few that allow you to use a frigate weapon on a interceptor. Eclipse is alright, but it really feels not good in intie form.
Overheating weapon does well, and feels quite good in intie form.

Spec mod makes you and a ally invincible, and regenerates shield. It is helpful.

Disadvantages:
Its kinda a sucky healer. Lack of defensive capabiltiy aside from undocking, low frigate rotation speed, low speed in general.

It just make up for mediocre spec mod.

--
interceptor
it has jump with cloak, and high damage cloak mine.
Its like, what else could you ask for?

Its good at harrasing players, and maybe picking up a destroy or two.
Very good for beacon capture, high speed, invis mines, sets itself well for defending a beacon against other interceptors.

KNTC - (KINETIC)



[Pulse Trigger] to the extreme. Seriously.

Its similar to Rails, but is harder to maintain.
On the other hand, it has more consistent dps due to its alternate firing sequence and higher ROF...
this is helpful for tracking small targets.


Why Thanatos over Rails
--
1. Much more range (30%) >>2
2. Less spread over time. *>>3
3. More damage time on target
*This means, its more effective at that range because low spread to damage.
4. 6600 kinetic explosion vs targets.

--

Rails has a lot more alpha damage than rails, and while thanatos tracks better at close range, rails is easily better at close ranges.
Rails also has more dps, but also has more sustained spread.

But. Thanatos does damage to nearby enemies when a target tagged by the debuff dies.
This has been quite helpful when dealing with packs of enemies.

--
Thanatos dps:
3039
2664.5
=3848 dps with crits.

Rails = 4179.8694 with crits

<div class="EA_Content">
A tried and true classic. This build requres high skill and precision, the reward is of course extremely high damage and effectiveness.

Make sure to lock on to target, pulse the trigger and you will be good to go.

Tharga
Any player who has dared to enter pvp, or any player who has played a long time..
Or any player..

(GET ON WITH IT!)

Knows Tharga. Its one of the very best fighters in the game.
Who knows how many people have died to that ship,
the number of inexperience players dying over and over and over...


aright you get it.

--

Is it worth getting for the average layman?
Yes

What modules are worth building?
How expensive is it?
How long would it take?
What do I need to get to be like the "pro's"?
Or the guys that kill you over and over again.

--
Thankfully its cheap.
But note that every node you buy makes it expensive.

I will make it simple on the things that set tharga apart that you can aim for.

1. Static shield generator
2. Combat shield generator
3. Inhibitor swarm
4. Resonating Shield

--
The easiest build to do well is a Crystal Hunger Rails build.
Cant go wrong with it(ish). Go for crits, practice your aiming, trigger discipline.

--
The thing with tharga is it can have very good regeneration, and unique ways of dealing damage.
More advanced builds have increased maneurverability and many other things.

--

Combat shield regenerator quite literally makes your sheilds take nothing if its light stuff.
And of course, more sources = faster regen.
Static shield, when you arent shooting or using modules, it significantly boosts shield regeneratoin.
This^^^ combined with shield pulse??*NAME!? makes it extremely potent with Tharga.
Inhibitor Swarm is a must, simple as that. Slows down targets and does damage to pick up fast pesky targets at low health.

Resonating shield.
