Marten is my favorite ship in the game.
Tactics and Thoughts:
Wormhole Stabilizer:
Instant teleport is a serious advantage, especially against an enemy.
-
IR Ammo: Easier to hit enemies in a turn fight, allows aiming blind, can help doppler theory. (Perceived DPS increase when moving in direction of projectile.)
-
Slowing Missiles and Mines

Cloak + Hologram = True decoy.

Spike:
Quick Tactics, Thoughts and Strategies:
[[Build is outdated!!!]]
Doppler Laser buff works with strafe speed as well. Possible to maintain 25% damage buff just by strafing. Strafing allows buff at low overall speeds.
-
Many good combinations of active modules exist for spike. Experiment and use them for your own build and needs.
-
EBM good for lazy interceptors, command fighters, groups of people, and destroyers.
-
White Noise Jammer. Very helpful when fighting ECM’s. Don’t brush it off.
-
Pirate Orion Targeting Complex does higher total damage than mk5 OTC
-
—suggestions
OTC, WNJ/EBM/Dagger, AC, Shield/Hull/Quantum

Kirishima SH/\RP Guide - TheRE1VAX

Its not gonna be great, but its not gonna be long.

Kirishima.
R17 Jeri Command Fighter.

—

What I am describing is my playstyle and thus build for it. Take what you can or would like to, this is what I use it for and what it means to me.

—

Kirishima - SH/\RP

Long range firepower
Ally support

—

Sower weapon is good at long ranges. What unlocked its effectiveness for me is high ROF and spikes of mines (using Shared Cooler).

This is also true because holding down the trigger too long increases spread and for certain targets this means its hard to hit them.

High range, effective vs Destroyers and Frigates. This is also true of Guard Frigates.

—

Explaining module selection.

And why spec mod.

Special Module allows you to make your allies invincible for a short time, which can be helpful in a variety of situations.

Solo it is more effective than regular shield.

Yes, there are bugs, but in my experience watch your range and be selective on who and if you have allies in range.

—
—

It excels by itself or with allies.

Thankfully close on allied defence/offence is good because it means enemies are close range enough to suck energy out of them to feed spec mod and keep allies invincible. Of course they also benefit from Command modules (Aegis).

And more than that, this means you can redirect ally damage into EC and have temporary very high damage for a time against an enemy.

This is what it is fun.
Spec mod, energy drainer, EC = punishment for those that touch your friends.

And you can swap sower and maybe do a crit railgun build for close range pummeling, but that might also require other changes such as taking Valkyre.
(Good pilgrim build ofc).

—

I keep shield booster for obvious reasons.

—

And that’s it. Kirishima SH/\RP.
Close range ally defense.
Long range offense firepower.

Protazan - 'VALENCE'

Think of 'VALENCE' like a mini Relic. Pot shots at fighters and interceptors. Good at long-medium range.

Valence boasts high effectivness vs (again), fighters, interceptors, and frigates. Pirate Cannon allows high effectiveness for in-field use, and this is especially true using Prota unique mod.

And for anything that needs more help, finish with Storm-D. Jump and cloak at your disposal to keep yourself in the right position, getting in range of enemies, and out of range of their attention. Multiphase allows tanking of damage while you hopefully jump to a safer place.

Quick Tips:
Strafing works well in this ship, use it to help leading shots. (as well as rolling of course).
Keep an eye on range.

"Variacent" -- Relic, R17, Jericho Destroyer

Primary Function:: Long Range Blockade/Support.

For those that don't know or understand Relic, it is an adept Jericho destroyer.
Its primarily built for defense and has high effectiveness vs long range slow targets.

Which any destroyer is good against, which makes Relic default loadout kind of niche.

Consider that Tyrant is much more offensive than its higher counterpart, what does Relic offer?

--
Forward: Relic - The most defensive destroyer.
--

[SpecMod] Reflecting Shield.
Everyone knows what it does. Makes a large shield outside of the ship that bounces non piercing projectiles back to enemy and gives 400shields resists internally when active.

This is what makes the Relic quite defendable, especially against other destroyers such as Zeta Pburster or Emperor (and of course many others). It highly discourages focus fire and can effectively float over high alpha attacks at medium range+.

I will be making use of this in this build--as it serves as a blockade function.

----
--The Build Itself
----

Relic was and perhaps and still is known for its 'fireworks', but im not going to focus on that for this build.

No, just as Tyrant is primarily a weapons build -- so too this will be.

The key is increasing projectile speed, and absolutely trounce most anything from frigates down. High weapon alpha is noted in this build.

Single taps, lazy aiming (free aiming) on anything at range makes this niche destroyer and niche build quite effective in a lot of situations.

Combine this with AOE spammy modules allows you to influence large portions of the map at medium ranges.


While reflecting shield, high shield resistance and regen allow this to tank a lot of damage from multiple sources--at range or close by.

Tyrant Destroyer Advanced Guide
-TheRE1\/-\><


Overview:
This guide is a advanced tactics and strategy guide for Tyrant. It covers primarily overral build and use strategies and tactics. This can be taken as itself or as extra information for your builds, playstyles, and information.



--
-[Summary]
-Tyrant, R14 Jericho Destroyer
--

Tyrant.
A name that impresses all players from the moment they hear it to the moment they see it.
Especially in more classic Star Conflict PVP the Tyrant was a destroyer to be feared. When in the hands of dedicated players, it truly played and lived up to its name -- a Tyrant.

This Jericho destroyer offers interesting gameplay abilities and tactics, rewarding skill, a tactical mind, timing, and strategy from the build, to the field.

This ship is highly technical.
Its modules, special components, Jericho buffs augment the concept that it responds very well to again, the tactical mind. To putting forth thought and effort into building and using it. Those who do so will get the most out of it.

Summary:
It is (supposed to be/often) a close ranged veritable brawler, capable (in the right hands with the right build) of taking on everything. From small agile interceptors, to being a destroyer destroyer.


A few general major points.
(Based on using its special abilities and modules).
-Destroying any enemy in a short range heals your shield
-A mine that benefits by damaging enemies in a close group at medium range.
-An onboard converter converts received damage to charges that can damage a targeted enemy in a short range while partially restoring shield.

This ends the brief summary.


--Upcoming Sections
This guide will be divided into sections.
-Personal Thoughts on builds
-Builds

Using
-General Strategies(and advanced)
-Tactics (and advanced)
-Other(?)





--
-Tyrant - Builds
--

--Forward
As stated in the summary, this is a highly technical ship platform. It allows for different types of build directions and gameplay(based on the build of course).

Even though this guide is split, build from playstyle, it is what you the player wants that makes this work. Build and playstyle of course synergize together. The goal is based from the playstyle, and enabling your playstyle is from the build. The build enables certain playstyles.

As that is, it is my opinion there are many viable different builds and playstyles to this ship.

This, of course, is where many disagree with this concept, often citing that there is the meta and only the meta. Why consider what is not meta?

[META
Most Effective Tactic(in general) Available]


Based on that concept, I could show you what the community feels is THE and thus the BEST Tyrant build. Which I will do(somewhere at the very end)[maybe?].

I would always take claims about a perfect meta build, especially in a ship like this, with a grain of salt.
Different goals, comfort levels, and the changing pvp landscape make the META a moving target when it comes down to per-user and per-goal and even per-situation.

-

With this in mind, I will be discussing different builds/playstyles and their advantages and disadvantages.

(Remember. Opinion. (Although a opinion based on evidence and objective(and subjective) thought and comparisons.)


Lets get into it!


--Builds
As with any R14 Destroyer, what often serves as the foundation of the build is the slots you choose from it.

In concepts, this stems from two decisions the user makes.

1. What is the main weapon?
2. Modules and Play/Build Style

Both of these support the users playstyle or goal.

So
Why like that and in that order?
Often the weapon dictates the main feel of the ship. And also it is of high importance to make main weapon usable or comfortable, and this requires slots. A meson build would take 2 or 3 cpu slots, a good Thermo build may take just two perhaps, another may only need 1 cpu for horizon.

Usually then you decide the rest of the build with what is available, often because the primary weapon is of higher importance.

In actuality, both are being applied before building slots, its just often the order of logic. Any user considers (and often has in mind) what he or she wants before building slots.


--weapon build ideas

:: Thermoactive Zenith Build
Thermoactive weapon is, in my opinion, the best and perhaps the highest potential weapon for Tyrant.

The weapon, as you likely know, increases critical chance as it heats up. Maintaining a level high on the heat meter requires trigger discipline, forethought, skill, and patience (among other generalized qualities).

This is my build. It has the following advantages...
- Projectile speed to hit interceptors
- High dps
- High critical damage (correlates with dps)
- Good range.

Often the things to balance are projectile speed and crit chance/damage. I believe my build is not only objectively optimal but it is also very comfortable to me, and thus subjectively the best (for the weapon in my playstyle).

It is mainly from the following:
Crew 2:A
Crew 6:C
Crew 11:A (or B)
Two Crit Dmg Modules
Horizon Module

"Why not crew for crit dmg and replace one of the crit dmg for crit chance?"

Because projectile speed is worth it.(in my playstyle).

If I can't hit targets, it doesn’t matter if I have a million alpha damage.

I also don’t really lose much without the crit chance module, its better to use weapon correctly to maintain higher crit chance. Better reward efficient usage of Thermoactive.
You could trade proj speed for crit dmg and have <70% crit chance for 121% crit damage. Be a kickin build. (I may consider doing that and seeing if its worth it but not being able to hit certain targets.)

Remember: Higher projectile speeds help enable horizon for smaller/faster targets. The farther the distance the more dramatic the aiming offset. 
Thus, I can still be accurate at longer ranges, which is more time on target, higher effectiveness, greater efficiency of time, and thus a more optimal configuration.


-calculating nominal critical hit dps increase.
What is the dps if we include crit chance and crit dmg?

Crit chance is represented as a percentage, or out of 100

Posted build stats.
5525 dps
70% crit chance
91% crit dmg

Multiply crit chance by crit dmg.
70*91=6370
since it is a percentage, divide it by 100
6370/100=63.7% more damage.
This is our damage multiplier.
5525*1.63= 9005 dps at nominal 70% crit chance.

Quick note: What if I traded proj speed for an extra 30% crit damage?

70*121=8470/100=84.7%
5525*1.84=10166 dps.

-Modules
--

This is where personal preference can come more into play. Different playstyles, range builds, combinations and much more can vary.

And while the community will undoubtedly reccommend a end-all be-all 'META' build, 

I've had success doing things differently, often to my preference. 

Sometimes that leads to the exact same 'META' build, and sometimes its slightly different, sometimes its absolutely different. 

<i>What is important is what is comfortable and what works for you. Often what you are more comfortable or are better at using can offset or even go higher than the 'META' build (if one truly exists).</i>

[[This will be copy and pasted for the Ship Build section mind you.]]


With that stated, let's get into some module ideas, strategies, concepts, and considerations.

-
-


Isotope Harvester:
I highly recommend as a must have.
"Well dur TheR."

--Strategies, Tactics, and Tips
-Can be used to get around corners
-Activate at a close object to spawn it closer to you, allowing you to damage a closer enemy (who may other wise dodge the slow moving field).
-Fire it when you see trouble coming.
-Fire it leading a target, such as a destroyer, so that by the time the field gets in distance range it will hit the enemy craft.
-It is quite effective vs destroyers.

They added a 1.25 total multiplier.
Why?, idk, but it has that so its even more OP.

This module is your primary lifeline of shield (at least in my build and in my opinion).

Use it wisely. A wise use can potentially heal half of your shield instantly. Using it effectively is what will enable you to outlast even a number of powerful enemies.

--Multiphase Shield Generator
I highly recommend as a must have.
"Again. Dur theR."

-Strategies Tactics and Tips
I know it is obvious. This is very important for all Jericho Destroyers and greatly increases your shield resistance. Shield resistances is essentially both the efficiency and effectivness of your shield.
As I will discuss later, Tyrant is geared towards regeneration in modules, which means you should focus on resistance and capacity for the build (and in general.)

(You should go for all of those in general, this is nothing new.)

It is a active module. And please understand.

Correct and wise usage of this module can be the difference between losing >50-80% of your shield, to your enemy wondering if their hits even registered. 

Don’t waste it. 

Either by using it too much or too little.

It also counts as a multipurpose module, so it is helpful for clearing debuffs.(This becomes more relevant with my playstyle.)



-Photon Emitter
Cited as a 'must have' for all destroyers by the community.

Nowadays, considering the pvp scene, I also tend to agree with them. It is certainly useful in a variety of situations, especially as the common meta is other destroyers.

It also has a unique synergy with Tyrant. You can fire it at a nearby object and damage yourself, which will charge your special module.

It also is a very effective module vs other destroyers, allowing this build to be more of a potential dessie killer.
 

-[Fourth Slot]
Some prefer wormhole, other prefer gravitational-lens, others prefer repelling beam. Tempest is meh, and most people think pyro is meh.

Wormhole: helpful for getting in and out of combat, helpful when getting swarmed by ships, or the sneak-attacking covert ops. Does some damage projectile as well.

Repelling Beam:
I personally like Repelling beam, because it keeps them at just the right range for my primaries. (has other uses also).

Pyro:
Another choice I liked for a while. it is surprisingly effective at orbiting inties and at medium ranges vs fighters. Close range against enemy dessies can also work rather well.


-

Missile slot
Shields, hull heal, or repelling drone.

Many pro players swear by repelling beam, and as far as I am concerned is described as the meta (although it varies per ship). Is overpowered (especially when it was untargetable and therefore hard to disable).

Shields:
My personal favorite. Allows to soak up damage, make players flank you, among other uses. This is what I use and I recommend.

--
--
--



--
-Playstyle
--

How this works:
I am going to describe some playstyle concepts and styles that Tyrant favors, and then my in-depth playstyle(s).

--

General Concepts(as an opinion).
To a degree, strategizing placement is essential to staying alive. Reading the map and making choices. Often deciding between where to apply damage, and what will also not put you in a sitatuon where you can't run and you won't live.

-Tyrant Favor
Tyrant favors close-mid range fighting. In this concept, rotation speed, accel, and top speed (in order of importance) help to make this strategy effective. Moving around enemy dessies, keeping Spec Mod active, and picking right time for your modules while spec passive steals from those destroyed in close range to you...

all while battering them with Thermo-Active. 


Close on offense, far on defense.

Note: It can become quite a handful to do all these at once.


--my playstyle
It's essentially what I have already talked about.

Close on offense, far on defense. I typically try and circle the border between teams, around the left and right sides of the typical map. Staying relatively close to allies also helps.

Also, always and I mean always moving. This helps to mitigate/deter any cov ops and such stalking you. And enables your adaptive shields.

When it comes to fighting dessies, you have to either commit or toe the line to not get drained to death. Albireo has infinite lives, you do not. 3 dessies vs you at long range at sustained time = most likely death. [[Remember: You are not Relic.]]

You need to be close to get around shields, use spec mod, and spec active mod, and also spec passive mod.

Pounding with thermo at close range is when it gets effective.

And since this build is combat regen based, you need combat. My relic build is mid-close range high regen. (among other things).

It is certainly a hands-on ship.

This completes the main guide.
Tyrant may yet still have a place in this game (albiet in niche situations), but when it does it is both effective and thoroughly enjoyable.

'VIZIANT' - Vigilant, R14 Empire Suppressor Class Destroyer


Description:
VIZIANT, a loadout and build for the Empire Destroyer Vigilant.
The build focuses on the tankiness of Vigilant and the damage of the Vacuum Resonance Laser.
This build offers extreme effectiveness in medium to long range engagements against many targets, as well as offering support for the team.


Strengths:
High tank factor and survivability.
High effectivess in medium-long ranges.
Area denial, beacon denial, ally support.


Weaknesses:
Notably weak in short ranges.
Very low mobility.
Regeneration is not high.
Weak vs. other Destroyers due to low mobility.


The Build::
This is a Laser range build, using thermal damage and mines to supply denial to an area and high damage to targets.


-Spatial Stabilizer-

This build offers extreme damage to targets around 7km range.
Very effective against fighters and frigates, can be effective vs interceptors (more so than typical destroyer weapons at range).

However the effectiveness is dependent on being in one place, which is not good for defensive when being attacked. Thankfully VIZIANT has very high one-way survivability and high range, allowing it to stay out of the direct heat if the battle and augment ally position or deny an open area of space or even play beacon defense.


Modules:
Pyro Emitter/Photon Emitter
Remote Mine Layer
Gravitational Lense
(Close Range Defense) Repelling Beam, Crystalline Suppressor, or a turret.



-Dealing With Interceptors and Fighter rushes-

Vulnerability Scanner does allow Vigilant to deal with close range targets.
This, combined with Remote Mine Layer at close range, can allow dealing with enemy ships.



-  <<< Gameplay/Playstyle >>>  -
VIZIANT is designed to be an actual suppression destroyer build, and the playstyle very much reflects this.

Your job is simple, and it is mainly area denial.
--Primary: Area suppresion and denial by long range effective weaponry.
--Secondary: Providing beacon support (if applicable) and Ally support in main territory.

As such, primary position is on the left or right flanks of ally territory stemming into middle-no-mans-land.
This provides you the ability to typically control a third of open airspace with an overpowered 7.7km Vaccuum Resonance Laser.

SHRAPNEL

This ship is very interesting.
With my build or playstyle, I note three things.

1. Extreme effectiveness vs Destroyers (obvious)
2. easy to pick up kills
3. High effectiveness vs Interceptors.

Its true Punisher only homes 4 projectiles, and thus do little damage.
But with OTC, you can finish off most of all low health interceptors. That is incredibly useful.

Its kinda a neat ship, that most of the time is kinda meh, but sometimes can get in the groove of finishing certain ships.

Punisher at close ranges (and a crit) does two shot damage. Sneaking up on interceptors, or fighters (like right on them) + OTC = 80% of their health. This is hard to do as the weapon is extra finicky at close ranges.

The weapon ofc is good against frigate hulls.

Spec Mod:
It sucks tbh. Its alright in scaring people, in taking out drones (especially Albireo drones), but the damage on a person is very very low. Even in a group the actual damage is still not punishing enough.

Its fine to slot, has niche uses, but you would be just fine with regular web.

Only other thing, it works at ranges. Don't need a lock on, that can be quite useful.

Irbis is the newest Federation tackler, and it is quite impressive.

This is a Rails build, I havent yet posted the regular build (with the special weapon).

Make sure to lock on, and ofc tap.
Aim assist is absolutely ridiculous in this. You will find high effectiveness vs interceptors,
ive tracked down 2 albireos (in intie form) that were cloaked, and destroyed them both. First time ive ever done that (without using AOE or getting help).

Don't underestimate cloak for attacking targets, and even using it to get around the map.
Feel free to swap out a few modules if you need target painter and target inhibitor.

Oh and the crew is your guess atm cuz i cant be bothered to include it.

Everyone says Ignis sucks. And they aren't necesarily wrong.

But with the right build, the right playstyle,
the right situation, and the right player.

It is a <b>LOT</b> of fun.

--

The posted build should already describe a lot for you.

When you decide to do a rush, you will be doing a lot of damage.

It is right in the middle of a strafe and a rotation build. This allows you to get more time on target during the rush, while maintaining effectiveness at orbit range.

If you want more damage, then swap out Supercooled for Supernova, be warned that this will make it hard to be helpful at range, considering this is a crit build and Ignis already has proj speed problems.

As you well know, higher ROF increases or rather, distributes crit chance correctly. You will better feel dmg increase from crits with higher ROF. This explains why use Wounded Beast (among other reasons) and crew 11:B (and yes this is obvious, but also on purpose).

--

High effectivness vs interceptors, fighters, multiple targets, and cloaked people.

I decided against running a Particle Purge build, because I need the modules it already has, and cuz I need speed.(or i am lazy.. your pick.)

Lacks a lot of alpha vs dessies, and lacks alpha for frigates...
although you can take out a frigate by yourself if you have time.

Do you like Wolfhound?
Do you like Lasers? (Preferably Ion Emitter)
Do you like having fun even if you lose?
Do you like high skill builds?

Then this should be fun.

It is pretty self explanatory.

Notes:
Know when to be say 3 clicks from fully zoomed in.
(as in, fully zoom in, unclick the zoom, two more clicks (scroll wheel clicks) and thats about the optimum distance)*
* of course, its individual and per resolutin.

Just know that sitting closer on the ship helps with aiming, and ofc zoom out when orbiting (if thats also your thing).

Spiral is a neat ship, one of the few that allow you to use a frigate weapon on a interceptor. Eclipse is alright, but it really feels not good in intie form.
Overheating weapon does well, and feels quite good in intie form.

Spec mod makes you and a ally invincible, and regenerates shield. It is helpful.

Disadvantages:
Its kinda a sucky healer. Lack of defensive capabiltiy aside from undocking, low frigate rotation speed, low speed in general.

It just make up for mediocre spec mod.

--
interceptor
it has jump with cloak, and high damage cloak mine.
Its like, what else could you ask for?

Its good at harrasing players, and maybe picking up a destroy or two.
Very good for beacon capture, high speed, invis mines, sets itself well for defending a beacon against other interceptors.

KNTC - (KINETIC)



[Pulse Trigger] to the extreme. Seriously.

Its similar to Rails, but is harder to maintain.
On the other hand, it has more consistent dps due to its alternate firing sequence and higher ROF...
this is helpful for tracking small targets.


Why Thanatos over Rails
--
1. Much more range (30%) >>2
2. Less spread over time. *>>3
3. More damage time on target
*This means, its more effective at that range because low spread to damage.
4. 6600 kinetic explosion vs targets.

--

Rails has a lot more alpha damage than rails, and while thanatos tracks better at close range, rails is easily better at close ranges.
Rails also has more dps, but also has more sustained spread.

But. Thanatos does damage to nearby enemies when a target tagged by the debuff dies.
This has been quite helpful when dealing with packs of enemies.

--
Thanatos dps:
3039
2664.5
=3848 dps with crits.

Rails = 4179.8694 with crits

<div class="EA_Content">
A tried and true classic. This build requres high skill and precision, the reward is of course extremely high damage and effectiveness.

Make sure to lock on to target, pulse the trigger and you will be good to go.

I figure i should just again start writing.
    
Tharga
Any player who has dared to enter pvp, or any player who has played a long time..
Or any player..

(GET ON WITH IT!)

Knows Tharga. Its one of the very best fighters in the game.
Who knows how many people have died to that ship,
the number of inexperience players dying over and over and over...


aright you get it.

--

Is it worth getting for the average layman?
Yes

What modules are worth building?
How expensive is it?
How long would it take?
What do I need to get to be like the "pro's"?
Or the guys that kill you over and over again.

--
Thankfully its cheap.
But note that every node you buy makes it expensive.

I will make it simple on the things that set tharga apart that you can aim for.

1. Static shield generator
2. Combat shield generator
3. Inhibitor swarm
4. Resonating Shield

--
The easiest build to do well is a Crystal Hunger Rails build.
Cant go wrong with it(ish). Go for crits, practice your aiming, trigger discipline.

--
The thing with tharga is it can have very good regeneration, and unique ways of dealing damage.
More advanced builds have increased maneurverability and many other things.

--

Combat shiel regenerator quite literally makes your sheilds take nothing if its light stuff.
And of course, more sources = faster regen.
Static shield, when you arent shooting or using modules, it significantly boosts shield regeneratoin.
This^^^ combined with shield pulse??*NAME!? makes it extremely potent with Tharga.
Inhibitor Swarm is a must, simple as that. Slows down targets and does damage to pick up fast pesky targets at low health.

Resonating shield.
